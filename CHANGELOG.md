- [UI] Now `SearchPlace.createFromSearchResult()` requires `ResponseInfo` as an additional argument.
- [UI] `SearchBottomSheetView.OnSearchResultClickListener.onSearchResultClick()` and `SearchCategoriesBottomSheetView.OnSearchResultClickListener.onSearchResultClick()` receive `ResponseInfo` as an additional argument.

### New features
- [CORE] `IndexableDataProviderEngineLayer` class now can be called from any thread.
- [CORE] Now selected search suggestions from `OfflineSarchEngine` are added to `HistoryDataProvider` by default. You can manage this behavior by passing custom `SelectOptions` to `select()` function.

Now user can remove several records in one go and also specify several operations that should be executed atomically for a given engine layer.
- [CORE] Now `OfflineSearchEngine` has a new functions for selecting preferable tileset - `selectTileset()`.

- [UI] Now `SearchPlaceBottomSheetView` class notifies users about adding specific `SearchPlace` to favorites via `SearchPlaceBottomSheetView.OnSearchPlaceAddedToFavoritesListener`.
- [UI] `SearchPlaceBottomSheetView` has a new `Feedback` button that enables users to report issues and send feedback on search quality. With this functionality also come `OnFeedbackClickListener` and functions to add/remove feedback listeners. Customers have to use `SearchFeedbackBottomSheetView` or implement feedback UI on their own.
- [UI] Now a new view `SearchFeedbackBottomSheetView` which implements feedback workflow is available. Customers can add their own listener via `addOnFeedbackSubmitClickListener()` to hook feedback sending to define their own behavior.
- [UI] Now `SearchBottomSheetView` has new interfaces `OnFeedbackClickListener`, and `OnFeedbackSubmitClickListener`. Customers can add their own listeners via `addOnFeedbackClickListener`, and `addOnFeedbackSubmitClickListener()` to hook feedback sending and define custom behavior.

### New features
- [CORE] New `SearchSuggestionType` subtype has been added. Now `SearchSuggestion` can have `Query` type, which means that selection of this suggestion type will result in new suggestions.
- [CORE] Now you can search along a route, pass `RouteOptions` to `SearchOptions` to configure route parameters.

- [CORE] New fields have been added to `HistoryRecord` and `FavoriteRecord` data classes which may break existing code.
- [CORE] String resource `app_name` has been removed from the core SDK. This resource was public by mistake and external modules normally shouldn't have used this.

- [CORE] `SearchSelectionCallback.onCategoryResult(results: List<SearchResult>)` callback has been added.
- [UI] From `SearchBottomSheetView`, `SearchPlaceBottomSheetView`, `SearchCategoriesBottomSheetView` classes removed functions that were available to simplify interaction with Kotlin functional interfaces.
With Kotlin 1.4.0 [SAM conversions for Kotlin interfaces](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/whatsnew14.html#sam-conversions-for-kotlin-interfaces) are available and these functions are not needed anymore.
Removing these functions from the SDK may bring breaking changes if you were accessing those functions from Java code (which is usually pointless) or if you are using older versions of Kotlin.

## v0.7.0

### New features
- [UI] Now if `SearchCategoriesBottomSheetView.open(Category)` is called with the latest set category, listeners will be notified about loaded results if they already loaded or loading will be initiated if the card's state is error.
- [UI] New properties `isNavigateButtonVisible`, `isShareButtonVisible`, `isFavoriteButtonVisible` for `SearchPlaceBottomSheetView` are available that manage buttons visible to user.
- [UI] Now it's allowed to set any number of items for hot categories section including zero. Hot categories section will be hidden in case of an empty list. However, to ensure the best behavior for the view, we recommend setting at most four items. Hot categories section does not support scrolling, if items don't fit into the view width, they will be flattened.
- [UI] Now `SearchResultsView` has `defaultSearchOptions` property which defines default options for search. To override these options, use `search(query: String, options: SearchOptions)` function.
- [UI] Now you can specify collapsed state anchor for `SearchBottomSheetView`. Desired anchor can be provided with `SearchBottomSheetView.Configuration`.

### Bug fixes
- [UI] Fixed a bug with `SearchBottomSheetView` when new configuration was ignored after activity recreation.

### Breaking changes
- [CORE] Some classes that used to be available in external modules have been moved to `com.mapbox.search.internal` package. These files should not be accessed in the customer's code and we do not guarantee their availability in the future.
- [CORE] Core SDK has been fully refactored, see new samples for more information.
- [UI] Removed `HotCategory` class. Now it's allowed to choose any category for hot categories section.
- [UI] Removed `SearchBottomSheetView.Configuration.categorySearchResultsLimit` property and its corresponding builder fields.
- [UI] We do not longer guarantee that returned by `SearchBottomSheetBehavior`, `SearchPlaceBottomSheetView`, and `SearchCategoriesBottomSheetView`'s `getBehavior()` function returns an instance of `com.google.android.material.bottomsheet.BottomSheetBehavior`. Use `addOnBottomSheetStateChangedListener` functions for watching card state changes and `state` property for getting current state.
- [UI] `SearchViewBottomSheetsMediator` is no longer part of the UI SDK and has been moved to the sample app.
- [UI] `SearchResultsView.initialize()` function has been removed. Now view can work without explicit initialization call. To provide search options, including results limit, use `search(query: String, options: SearchOptions)` function.
- [UI] `SearchBottomSheetView.Configuration.searchResultsLimit` property and its corresponding builder functions have been removed. Now you can provide `SearchOptions` that includes results limit.

### Bug fixes
- [UI] Fixed a bug with BottomSheetBehavior when it came to the incorrect state after state restoration in some cases.

### Breaking changes
- [CORE] SearchError has been renamed to SearchNetworkRequestException. Now it extends RuntimeException() and contains error cause.
- [UI] `SearchPlaceBottomSheetView.addOnNavigateClickListener()` and `SearchPlaceBottomSheetView.addOnShareClickListener()` functions now accept lambdas which take argument of type `SearchPlace`.



## v0.5.0

### New features
- [UI] Added SearchPlaceBottomSheetView.
- [UI] Added SearchCategoriesBottomSheetView.
- [UI] Added auxiliary functions for SearchBottomSheet state management: `open()`, `expand()`, `hide()`, `restorePreviousNonHiddenState()`.
- [UI] Miles support. Now UI SDK detects measurement system from current device locale and formats distances in corresponding distance unit.
- [CORE] Added `SearchEngine.setAccessToken(String)` function.

### Bug fixes
- [CORE] In some cases SDK couldn't get last known location.

### Breaking changes
- [UI] Removed SearchResultListener, use `SearchBottomSheetView.OnSearchResultClickListener` and `SearchBottomSheetView.OnCategoryClickListener` instead.
    Category search functionality has been removed from `SearchBottomSheetView`, instead now `SearchCategoriesBottomSheetView` implements category search.
- [UI] Removed `UserFavoriteOnClickListener`, use `SearchBottomSheetView.OnFavoriteClickListener` instead.
- [UI] Removed `SearchCloseListener`. Now `SearchBottomSheetView` does not have close button, instead the card resets its state when it collapses.
- [CORE] Removed `SearchResult.distance()` function, instead `DistanceCalculator` class is available, also you can use `LatLng.distanceTo(LatLng)` function.
- [CORE] Removed `SearchEngine.destroy()` function. Now `SearchEngine` must be initialized only once, in case of reinitialization attempt `IllegalStateException` will be thrown.
